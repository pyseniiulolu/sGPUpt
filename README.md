# sGPUpt
sGPUpt is designed for desktop VFIO users looking to passthrough their only GPU.

### [Functionality]
* Validates IOMMU groups
* Installs required packages
* Compiles spoofed QEMU & EDK2 OVMF
* Creates hooks for single GPU passthrough
* Creates a VM based on your system specs with additional features and optimizations

# Prerequisites
* Enable AMD-V/VT-x in your BIOS
* Disable CSM in your BIOS
* Disable ReBAR in your BIOS.

if you have an Intel CPU then add these parameters to grub:
>intel_iommu=on iommu=pt

# Usage
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexi-src/sGPUpt/master/sGPUpt.sh
chmod +x sGPUpt.sh
sudo ./sGPUpt.sh
```

# Troubleshooting

### [Black screen/BIOS screen]
Known reasons this can occur:
* If you use an Arch-based distro then you may need to load the [vfio modules](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#mkinitcpio) early
* The hooks are failing because a program is still using the GPU.
* If you have an older card that doesn't have UEFI support you'll need a VBIOS.

### [Device is not isolated]
Your GPU is grouped with other devices which means you're unable to pass it unless you use a kernel with the ACS patch.

* ACS for Debian - Install [XanMod](https://xanmod.org/) kernel then add **pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction** to grub.
* ACS for Arch - **sudo pacman -S linux-zen** then add **pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction** to grub.

⚠️ **NOTE**: The ACS patch has inherent security risks and *can* damage hardware. ⚠️
